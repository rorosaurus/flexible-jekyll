I created a custom [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) firmware, forked from [DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware), which adds some custom animations and QoL fixes to the already endless potential granted by Unleashed! I'll occasionally update this firmware to keep up with Unleashed releases.

## What's so exciting about this nerdy Tamagotchi?

When a thoughtful friend gifted me a Flipper, I was surprised and excited! Sometimes your friends know you better than you know yourself! ðŸ˜… Thank you Austin!! ðŸ’œ This tool is something I've always wanted to build myself (with a lesser scope), so it's been thrilling to dive in and learn all about these security technologies and how they work.

For example, when Alesha needed a friend to watch her cat, her apartment complex issued her a spare card key. Using my Flipper, I compared that key with her original to find that they issued a new identifier for this spare! Good security! Now if the spare is lost or copied, that identifier can be marked as untrusted without impacting Alesha's main key. It's a small detail but one that definitely builds confidence in where you live!

I'm excited to keep learning and testing everything I can get my hands on! Transit cards, amiibos, IR codes, RFID fuzzing, you name it! On top of that, the [BadUSB/RubberDucky](https://docs.flipperzero.one/bad-usb) and [GPIO expansion boards](https://docs.flipperzero.one/gpio-and-modules) create nearly endless potential for testing computers, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth HID devices, and more!

## "But like, why make this custom firmware?"

When I realized that the Flipper LCD was 128x64px (the same resolution I chose for my [Furret Totem](https://github.com/rorosaurus/FurretTotem) project) I knew what had to be done! It wasn't very tricky to re-render my .gif files into dithered monochrome, separate the frames, and compile them for Flipper. Now others can enjoy these animations too!

### I give you: [Furret-Zero-Unleashed](https://github.com/rorosaurus/furret-zero-unleashed)!
