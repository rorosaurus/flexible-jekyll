One day I decided I want to discover a prime number of my very own.

After a bit of research, and **203.53 quadrillion** floating-point operations later, I became the proud father of:

## 5687 · 2<sup>1376451</sup> + 1

a **414,357 digit-long** [titanic](http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=TitanicPrime) [Proth Prime](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProthPrime.html)!  As of ``1/29/2016 06:20:31 CDT``, this is the **2,261<sup>st</sup> largest prime ever discovered!**

This Proth Prime Search was done in collaboration with the [Proth Search](http://www.prothsearch.net/index.html) project. This search looks for primes in the form of k · 2<sup>n</sup> + 1, with the condition 2<sup>n</sup> > k.  These are often called Proth primes.

Thanks to the [PrimeGrid](http://www.primegrid.com/) project and [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) for making this pretty easy to get started!
