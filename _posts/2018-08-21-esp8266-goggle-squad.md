## Let's make a synchronized LED Goggle Squad using the ESP8266!

This project contains code and instructions to build a squad of rechargable LED goggles that automatically synchronize their animations with each other!  You can change the code parameters slightly to work with different LED strip types or lengths!

%}

Right now, we have about 30 unqiue members of the squad. Most people have created goggles, but some have created backpacks, bike lights, a tall flagpole, massage table underglow, and more! They all sync together using the same ESP8266 board to create a mesh network (over wifi) and sync their animations!

## Make your own!
Follow my [assembly instructions](https://github.com/rorosaurus/esp8266-goggles/blob/master/assembly.md) to make your own Goggles/Backpack/Bike-pole/etc. and join our squad!

## How to use yours
