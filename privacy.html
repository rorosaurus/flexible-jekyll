    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>I use Google Analytics to obtain anonymized metrics about how many visitors come here. This stores a cookie on your device.</p>
    <p>I referred to <a href="https://www.cookieconsent.io/blog/do-i-need-a-cookie-consent-when-using-google-analytics/" target="_blank">CookieConsent.io</a> to best understand how to respect your privacy. The steps I&#39;ve taken include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymized all visitors IP addresses</li>
        <li>Turned off Google Analytics data sharing</li>
        <li>Accepted the Google Analytics Data Processing Amendment: 
            <ul>
                <li>(The Google Ads Data Processing Terms are meant for businesses affected by the European Economic Area (EEA) <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/google-europe/gdpr-europe-data-protection-rules/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, the <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/rdp/">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>, or other similar regulations.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Created a clear privacy page about the use of Google Analytics âœ…</li>
        <li>Deactivated Google Analytics Features for advertisers</li>
        <li>Deactivated Google Analytics Remarketing and Reporting functions for advertisements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, there is one functional cookie that may be used to privately add my phone number to the vCONTACT download, if you were referred to my website via my business card. It contains no privately identifiable information except my own. :) I did this to prevent publicly hosting my phone number!</p>
