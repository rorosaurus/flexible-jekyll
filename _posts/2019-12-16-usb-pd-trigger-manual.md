[GreatScott made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAZqJ4wpJg) that featured some useful new USB power delivery trigger boards! Now there are many people jumping on these cheap solutions to convert any device to USB-C!

I haven't been able to find good, detailed info about these USB-PD triggers, so I figured I'd document my findings [here](https://github.com/rorosaurus/usb-pd-trigger-manual) to save random internet-goers some time and trouble!
